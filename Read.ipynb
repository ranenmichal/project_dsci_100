    "**Broad:** What player characteristics and behaviours predict subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these vary by player type?  \n",
    "**Specific:** Does the amount of time a player spends on video games correlate with subscription status?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the questions, each explanatory variable will be compared individually with the response variable (subscribe).  \n",
    "- Visualize each variable against the response to identify potential associations.  \n",
    "- Qualitative variables: use chi-square tests; lower p-values indicate stronger predictors.  \n",
    "- Quantitative variables: use K-NN; evaluate RMSPE for prediction accuracy.  \n",
    "- Data will be split into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) sets, with cross-validation to improve reliability.  \n",
    "- Additional visualizations will assess relationships among explanatory variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is appropriate because it directly addresses the research questions using simple, well-established methods. Assumptions include truthful responses and sufficient data size. A limitation is the reliance on visualizations, which may introduce subjectivity in interpretation.\n",
